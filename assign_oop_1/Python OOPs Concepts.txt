Python OOPs Concepts:

Like Java and C++, Python is also based on OOPs Concept, i.e, Python is an object-oriented programming language which uses classes and objects for computations.

Advantages of Python being a Object Oriented Programming Language:

Development and maintenance of Python codes is easier than the procedural programming.
Python can easily solve the real world problems as it does not works on step by step instructions.
Data in Python codes are secure due to its special feature of data hiding.
Principles of OOPs:

An object oriented programming is based on seven fundamental principles.

Object
Class
Method
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Data Abstraction
